# PythonProjects
A collection of personal projects coded in Python. Typically simple calculators or ports of programs from other languages that do not warrant their own Project.

File Information:

bingo.py - A text based python game. Everytime you press ENTER the game draws a new number not called before. This was created because of a poorly executed bingo game where by the middle of the game there were a lot of numbers already called.

cicada.py - A computation of a Discrete Math problem, it calculates the year of the last trifecta of three different broods of Magicicada cicada emergences.

det.py - A calculator to find the determinate of a 3x3 matrix. Was useful during my time in Linear Algebra.

qemuCom.py - A utility for creating a copyable string to be pasted in a terminal given a file name (no extension!) to run the ARM64 file using qemu. Useful for those coding in ARM64 and Qemu.

sieve.py - A adaptation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes pseudocode given in CS385 (Algorithms).

sqrtNewton.py - A adaptation of Newton's Method for calculating square root.

time2sec.py - A  converter for time format HHMMSS to seconds. This was to aid in adding the duration of tracks in my Calloc program.

zodiac.py - A utility for finding what year of the Chinese Zodiac was for a given year.
